# midterm-GAN
update-1

Steps:

* Train a binary classifier (called A) on the dataset using transfer learning (exactly like Assignment 1). The images should be downscaled to 128x128
* Next, train the SRGAN to generate 128x128 images. Each image of the training is downscaled to 32x32.
* Show some examples of scaled images in JNB
* Utilize the images generated by SRGAN in order to train a new model (called B)
* Train the SRGAN for at least 150 epochs
* Divide the dataset into 70% training and 30% testing
* Apply normalization and image transformation, and demonstrate some of the transformed samples
* Compare the performance of both models using different metrics such as F1, Accuracy, AUC
* Since there is limited time to use Google Colab GPU every 12 hours, save your models after each n epoch
